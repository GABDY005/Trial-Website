                    <p>On this page you will find some information about “Lessons Learned” which is what we and other coordinators have learned when setting up a Chat Seat. There is also some information on what we said when attracting Listeners. There are graphics that we used on the banner, name tags and logos. You are very welcome to use them.</p>
                  
                    <p>A Chat room is also available where you can chat with other Coordinators to exchange ideas or give support.</p>

                    <h5><strong>Looking for volunteers who enjoy listening to other people’s stories.</strong></h5>
                  
                    <p>We will be setting up a <strong>Chat Seat</strong> in “Name your Venue”1 over the next few weeks.</p>
                  
                    <p>The purpose of the <strong>Chat Seat</strong> is to connect members of the community through conversation.</p>

                    <p><strong>So, what will be involved?</strong></p>
                  
                    <p>People such as yourself can be a volunteer, acting as a Listener, by spending some time at a <strong>Chat Seat</strong> within <strong>“The Venue.”</strong> Their purpose is to encourage members of our community to come and chat.</p>
                  
                    <p>Some members of the community may be experiencing loneliness and isolation. We hope these individuals will sit down, feel listened to and start to feel connected to their community.</p>
                  
                    <p>So, who do we need?</p>
                    <p> Individuals who enjoy listening to others and have two hours a week to commit to such an activity.</p>
                  
                    <p>At this stage we only need five such people.</p>
                  
                    <p>So, if you are interested, you can look at our webpage,<a href="https://chatseats.com.au" target="_blank">https://chatseats.com.au</a>  , to find out more.  If you still interested, message me so that we can talk further and explain in more detail what is involved.</p>

                    <h5><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h5>
                    <p>Below are some of the lessons we have learned when establishing <strong>Chat Seats</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Selection of listeners – need to ensure they are interested in other peoples’ experiences and have well developed listening skills.</li>
                      <li>Have one very experienced listener who sits with other less experienced listeners.</li>
                      <li>Listeners work in pairs.</li>
                      <li>It is important that it is about listening and not counselling.</li>
                      <li>Have banners and graphics ready when talk to venue managers.</li>
                      <li>Be prepared to be flexible about location of chat seats and style.</li>
                      <li>Be prepared to do whatever induction activities, et cetera that are required by the venue.</li>
                      <li>Observe the requirements of the venue.</li>
                      <li>To have certain clearances as required by the venue manager.</li>
                      <li>Check out with venue manager on a regular basis that everything is Okay or if we need to change somethings.</li>
                      <li>Advertised times on the website of when <strong>Chat Seats</strong> will be available at a particular venue.</li>
                      <li>Get together for listeners, biannually?</li>
                      <li>Inter-generational listeners a plus.</li>
                      <li>Materials to help with development of Listening skills.</li>
                      <li>Badge to wear “Hello my name is …….”.</li>
                      <li>A plus if tea/coffee is available.</li>
                      <li>Great if the venue advertises that the <strong>Chat Seats</strong> are available at their venue.</li>
                    </ul>
