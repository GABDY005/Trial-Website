    <h4>Looking for volunteers who enjoy listening to other people’s stories.</h4>
    <p>
      We will be setting up a Chat Seat in <strong>“Name your Venue”</strong> over the next few weeks.
      The purpose of the Chat Seat is to connect members of the community through conversation.
    </p>

    <h5>So, what will be involved?</h5>
    <p>
      People such as yourself can be a volunteer, acting as a listener, by spending some time at a Chat Seat within <strong>“The Venue”</strong>.
      Their purpose is to encourage members of our community to come and chat. Some members of the community may be experiencing loneliness and isolation.
      We hope these individuals will sit down, feel listened to and start to feel connected to their community.
    </p>

    <h5>So, who do we need?</h5>
    <p>
      Individuals who enjoy listening to others and have two hours a week to commit to such an activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage we only need five such people.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, if you are interested, you can look at our webpage, <strong>chatseats.com.au</strong>, to find out more.
      If you’re still interested, message me so that we can talk further and explain in more detail what is involved.
