        <h1 class="mb-4 fw-bold text-center">Welcome to “Chat Seats”</h1>
    
        <p>
            In a bid to tackle social isolation, we would like to establish a series of chats seats across Australia.
            The <strong>Chat Seats</strong> initiative aims to provide a safe and inviting place for people to talk.
            It will allow members of the community to <em>“Connect through Conversation.”</em>
            For this initiative to be successful we need people like yourselves to volunteer to be either Listeners and/or Coordinators.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            This website is also open to individuals who may have stopped to chat on one of our Chat Seats.
            If you are looking for when a particular Listener is scheduled to visit your Chat Seat,
            please sign in and go to the Calendar and find your venue and Listener.
        </p>
    
        <p><strong>What do we mean by being a Listener or Coordinator?</strong></p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Listeners</strong> are individuals who volunteer their time to sit on a <strong>Chat Seat</strong> and listen to members of the community who may join them.
            Some of these members of the community may also be lonely and/or isolated. We are hoping to connect them back into their community through conversation.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            So, who would be a great volunteer? Someone who enjoys listening to other people and is interested in what is happening for them.
            Also, someone who has a couple of hours each week where they would like to sit at one of our <strong>Chat Seat</strong> locations.
            Does this sound like you?
        </p>
    
        <p>
            If you would like to volunteer as a Listener, then you will need to sign in and proceed to the page for Listeners.
            On this page you will find some helpful information, a booking calendar and a place where you can chat with other Listeners.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Coordinators</strong> are individuals who are also volunteers and may also choose to be Listeners.
            They will help to establish a site and support the Listeners.
            So, who would be a good Coordinator? Someone who enjoys negotiating with potential venue “managers” and has good organisational skills.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            If you would like to volunteer as a Coordinator, then you will need to sign in and proceed to the page for Coordinators.
            On this page you will find some helpful information, and a place where you can chat with other Coordinators.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            How do you identify a chat seat? It will have a banner like the one below, at one of our <strong>Chat Seats</strong> locations.
        </p>
    
        <div class="text-center my-4">
            <img src="assets/New_banner.png" alt="Chat Seat Banner" class="img-fluid" />
        </div>
    
        <p>We hope you have the passion and the time to be part of this initiative.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit our website. We welcome any suggestions.</p>
    
        <p class="mt-4">Warm regards,</p>
        <p><em>Tricia and Noel</em></p>
